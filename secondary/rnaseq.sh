### You'll run this if you've generated results from primary analysis in fslustre with nextflow

# mkdir -p ~/GEDI/demo/rnaseq
# cd ~/GEDI/demo/rnaseq
# cp -r /fslustre/labs/ext_mohammedismail_wazim_mayo_ed/GEDI/results/counts/*_htseq.tab .

### We'll take a shortcut; all the required files from primary analysis are compiled in the demo folder

cd ~/GEDI/demo/rnaseq

ls
